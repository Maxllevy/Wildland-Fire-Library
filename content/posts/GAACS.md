The United States is divided into 10 Geographic Areas to allow for cost effective and timely mobilization of wildland firefighting resources to incidents nationwide. Each Geographic Area has multiple local dispatch centers that fall under their sphere of influence. 

The primary mission for each Geographic Area is to coordinate the movement of resources within the Geographic Area and export resources to other Geographic Areas as needed.
