The Joint Fire Science Program (JFSP) provides leadership to the fire science community by identifying high-priority fire science research needs that will enhance the decision making ability of fire and fuels managers, natural resource managers, and others to meet their management objectives.

The program also meets the decision needs of those involved in developing and implementing fire-related policy. The programâ€™s breadth of stakeholders has broadened over the years commensurate with its science mandate; however, the JFSP remains focused on actionable science and tangible outcomes that meet the needs of end users.
