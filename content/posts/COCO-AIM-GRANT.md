COCO (a Colorado-based nonprofit) started the Action, Implementation and Mitigation (AIM) Program to accelerate fire adaptation concepts and reduce the risk from wildfire across the U.S. by increasing capacity and on-the-ground work. 

COCO hopes to increase community resilience, restore fire-adapted ecosystems and create safer conditions for residents and firefighters. 

This funding opportunity is open to organizations working to advance wildfire risk reduction. Applicants must demonstrate how their proposal fits into the larger community wildfire strategy, including coordination with federal partners on nearby public lands. Applicants must contribute a 100% match (cash or in-kind match is eligible).  Award funding may range from $10,000 â€“ $75,000. Grants are contracted for a period of one year.
